- You MUST update covid-maps-config.js with your own Google Charts API key!

- In the same file, you can change the number of weeks ago to compare against current data. I chose 2 weeks because it seems to be a "generation" in terms of viral spread - ie, changes to a lockdown status take about 2 weeks to show up in the data.

6/16/2020 UPDATE:

I originally compared total cumulative case counts to calculate the % increase for each state, but as time went on, I realized it would only capture 1st waves, not subsequent waves or states with a previously high number of cases.

So I changed Total Cases to Weekly Cases and compared 7-day counts, now and X weeks ago. Since the % change can now be negative, I changed the white->red color system to green->yellow->red, like a stoplight. I also removed states where either weekly count is below 50 - with that few cases, any trend is statistical noise.

9/4/2020 UPDATE:

The daily US state data object has become pretty large, so I added a PHP script and set up a cron to download and preprocess it overnight. I'm also seeing intermittent JS errors from the google object, but I'm not yet sure what's wrong or how to fix it.

I also added this to crontab: 0 1 * * * php /home/mbarklage/mikebarklage.com/codesamples/covid-maps/processAPIdata.php
